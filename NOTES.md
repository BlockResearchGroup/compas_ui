# Notes

* a session is a way to associate additional (arbitrary) data with compas data objects and/through? corresponding scene objects
* but the scene stuff is optional
* it is a display and/or visualization layer around the (session) data
* every visualization/scene object references a data object
* and overlays the data instance locally with modifiers
* only the data and the overlay settings are required for reconstruction
